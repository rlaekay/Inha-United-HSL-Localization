## Updates
- no random injections
- angular gates enhanced

## In Future
- Initial pose estimation needs to be improved
- Parallel computing to efficiently compute within scarce resources

# K1_Robocup Demo
## introduction
The Booster K1 Robocup official demo allows the robot to make autonomous decisions to kick the ball and complete the full Robocup match. It includes three programs: vision, brain, and game_controller.

-   vision
    -   The Robocup vision recognition program, based on Yolo-v8, detects objects such as robots, soccer balls, and the field, and calculates their positions in the robot's coordinate system using geometric relationships.
-   brain
    -   The Robocup decision-making program reads visual data and GameController game control data, integrates all available information, makes judgments, and controls the robot to perform corresponding actions, completing the match process.
-   game_controller
    -   Reads the game control data packets broadcast by the referee machine on the local area network, converts them into ROS2 topic messages, and makes them available for the brain to use.

##  Install extra dependency
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-backward-ros

## Note
This repo support jetpack 6.2. Adapted to the default TRT model in src/vision/config/vision.yaml.
